The challenge consisted of the creation of a card component, containing a QR code image, a Heading and a paragraph. This was achieved by using plain HTML and CSS. 
To implement cross-device compatibilty, a media query was used

## My process

After reding the challenge and the style guide, the images provided by Front-End-Mentor were copied into a subdirectory of the local project-directory. After that, an index.html-file was created and the bare structure was created using HTML. The elements were provided with selectors. With the selectorsin place, CSS was appplied to the elements. Finally, meta files ( screenshots, readme ) were created and the site was published using Git Hub Pages.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

Nothing in this challenge was completely new for me. I have used all the technologies before. 

### Continued development

I am not comfortable with creating reponsive designs yet. Using media queries efficiently is something I need to focus on in the future.
